## The Problem

260 million students are enrolled in higher education worldwide. Most use AI tools that do one thing: spit out answers. The student copies, submits, learns nothing. The tool enables academic dishonesty at scale.

Meanwhile, every professor uploads PDFs, lecture slides, and assignments to Google Classroom - and none of it gets connected to the AI. Students ask ChatGPT about photosynthesis and get a generic Wikipedia response when they should be getting an explanation grounded in *what their professor actually taught*.

EduVerse was built to fix both problems.

## What It Does

EduVerse syncs with a student's Google Classroom, ingests their actual course materials, and uses a **multi-agent system of 15+ specialized Gemma 4 nodes** to teach through questions, analogies, and conceptual scaffolding - never direct answers.

Three agent swarms handle distinct educational workflows:

**RAG Tutor** - Socratic explanations grounded in course materials. The system retrieves relevant docs, builds a chain-of-thought reasoning trace, then drafts an explanation that guides the student to the answer through questions and analogies. An adversarial validator fact-checks every claim against the source documents. If it finds hallucinations, it sends the draft back for revision - automatically.

**Quiz Engine** - Parallel MCQ generation mapped to Bloom's taxonomy. Three drafter workers run simultaneously via LangGraph's `Send()` API, each producing a question with intentionally designed distractors. A reviewer quality-gates the set and can reject + regenerate the entire batch.

**Feedback Analyst** - Root-cause analysis of student answers. A diagnostician agent uses code execution and web search tools to verify student work, then a mentor agent scores the feedback through a growth-mindset lens. If the feedback is too harsh, it loops back for revision.

Every swarm feeds into a **Critic Agent** that performs a final quality audit. If the critic rejects the output, the entire graph re-runs from the orchestrator - up to 2 self-correction cycles. A triple-layer guardrail system (input moderator -> integrity guard -> output shield) ensures no direct answers, no PII leaks, and no prompt injection.

The entire reasoning process is transparent. Every agent's `<think>` trace is extracted and rendered in an **X-Ray panel** in the UI, so the student can see exactly how the AI reached its response.

## Why Gemma 4

We didn't just swap in Gemma 4 as a drop-in replacement. The architecture was designed around specific Gemma 4 capabilities:

| Capability | How We Use It | Where |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Native `<think>` CoT** | Every pedagogical agent triggers explicit reasoning with `<think>` tokens. We extract these traces for the X-Ray transparency panel. | Generator, Diagnostician, all Guardrails |
| **Structured Output** | Every agent uses `with_structured_output()` for typed schemas - `PlannerOutput`, `QuizQuestion`, `CriticOutput`, `SafetyOutput`, etc. No regex parsing. | All 15+ nodes |
| **Multimodal Vision** | Students can upload photos of diagrams, handwritten problems, or textbook pages. The generator processes image+text natively. | RAG Generator, Quiz Drafters, Diagnostician |
| **Function Calling** | Validator and Reviewer agents autonomously call web_search and python_repl tools to fact-check claims and verify math. | Validator, Reviewer, Diagnostician |
| **MoE Efficiency** | The 26B-A4B model activates only 4B params per token - perfect for parallel execution across 3+ concurrent drafters without blowing the latency budget. | Quiz Drafters, Critics, Guardrails |

### Model Routing

We use three Gemma 4 variants, matched to task complexity:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Gemma 4 26B-A4B-IT (MoE)     - 4B active / 26B total    │
│  Used for: Routing, guardrails, validators, quiz drafters │
│  Why: Fast. 4B active params = near-edge latency.         │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Gemma 4 31B-IT (Dense)       - Full 31B parameters       │
│  Used for: RAG generation, feedback root-cause analysis   │
│  Why: Maximum reasoning depth for pedagogical tasks.      │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Gemini 2.5 Pro (Teacher)     - Background only           │
│  Used for: DPO distillation, evaluation judging           │
│  Why: Gold-standard for offline training data. Never on   │
│       the live student path.                              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All chains include a Gemini 2.5 Flash fallback via `.with_fallbacks()` — if the Gemma 4 endpoint returns a 500, the system degrades gracefully rather than crashing.

## The DPO Self-Improvement Pipeline

This is the part that makes EduVerse more than a demo.

Every time a validator rejects a draft and the generator revises it, the system captures a DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) pair: the rejected version becomes the "losing" response, the revised version becomes the "winning" response. This happens automatically, across all three swarms, on every student interaction.

```
Student asks a question
  -> Agent drafts response
  -> Validator finds a grounding issue
  -> Rejected draft saved as "rejected" ←──── DPO pair
  -> Agent revises
  -> Validator approves
  -> Approved draft saved as "chosen"  ←──── DPO pair
                    ↓
        MongoDB (dpo_pairs collection)
                    ↓
     Shadow Auditor adds teacher gold-standard
     responses via Gemini 2.5 Pro (background)
                    ↓
     Training Orchestrator exports to Kaggle
     -> DPO fine-tuning on T4 GPU
     -> Pairwise Teacher-as-Judge evaluation
     -> Auto-promote to HuggingFace if improved 15%+
```

The end goal: once enough DPO pairs accumulate per agent role, the system fine-tunes **Gemma 4 E4B** (a model small enough for consumer hardware) using distilled knowledge from the larger cloud models. Every student interaction makes the future local model better.

**Current state:** We're in the data collection phase. The pipeline is live and logging. Training triggers when any agent accumulates 150+ DPO pairs.

## Challenges We Hit

**Gemma 4 structured output inconsistency.** The 26B MoE model sometimes returns raw text instead of structured tool calls. We built a fallback parser that regex-extracts JSON from the raw response content when `with_structured_output()` fails to parse. See `rag_subgraph.py:61-74`.

**HITL checkpoint serialization.** LangGraph's `interrupt()` requires all state to be serializable to MongoDB. We had to flatten complex objects (LangChain `Document`s, Pydantic models) into plain dicts before checkpointing and reconstruct them after resume.

**DPO pair quality.** Early revision cycles produced noisy pairs where both "chosen" and "rejected" were bad. The Shadow Auditor (Gemini 2.5 Pro teacher distillation) was added specifically to inject higher-quality "chosen" examples into the training set.

**Retrieval grounding.** A naive RAG setup produced confident-sounding hallucinations. Adding the 3-tier confidence labeling (`GROUNDED` / `LOW_CONFIDENCE` / `INSUFFICIENT`) with the HITL gate gives the student control over when the system reaches outside course materials.
